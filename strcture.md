- [x] read file
	- [x] store vertex (position, index)
	- [x] store edge <v1, v2>, add &it to v1, v2's pair set
	- [x] store plane <v1, v2, v3>

- [x] build heap
	- [x] traverse plane, cal a, b, c, d
		- [x] add to Q of v1, v2, v3
	- [ ] traverse (vi, vj)
		- [x] judge if it's edge (search vj in vi's neighbor)
			- [x] if not edge
				- [x] judge t
					- [x] if t
						- [x] add pair
		- [x] cal cost, add cost to pair(edge)
		- [x] cal v, add to pair(edge)
		- [ ] add into heap
- [ ] remove point from heap
	- [ ] judge number
	- [ ] replace v1 with v
	- [ ] mark v2 as deleted, add "merge to v1" mark
	- [ ] traverse pair\* set of to v2, add v2's pair set to v1's
	- [ ] traverse pair next to v1, update cost and v.
- [ ] write to file
	- [ ] traverse vertex
		- [ ] write undeleted vertex, update index
		- [ ] if v is deleted, use merge to to find the real position, use stack to update index.
	- [ ] traverse plane
		- [ ] traverse v1, v2, v3
			- [ ] if not vi's index = vj's index write plane.
